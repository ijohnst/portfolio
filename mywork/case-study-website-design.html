                Explore the story behind the creation of my personal website — a
                digital space crafted to reflect my skills, projects, and
                personality. This project required my skills in designing,
                coding, and curating content in order to bring this online
                portfolio to life. The goal of the project is to have a digital
                space to share my professional skills with the world.

              <p>
                Drawing upon my background in project management and digital
                marketing, I was the sole architech of this project and
                orchestrated every aspect of the website's evolution, from
                ideation to implementation. This was entirely a solo effort so I
                did all of the design work, color and image selection, coding,
                analytics and publication myself.

          <h3 class="mb-500 h3">Background</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to the creation of this website my professional online
            presence was minimal at best. I have had a LinkedIn profile for many
            years and a well crafted resume, but not much else to showcase the
            variety of work I have done in my career. I have a diverse
            background of skills in Project Management, Content Management and
            Web Design. Unfortunately other than a few bullet points on a resume
            and a few past attempts at hastily put together Wordpress websites,
            I did not have a place to showcase these skills and the work I've
            done.

          <p class="pb-500">
            The primary objectives of this project were to create a place to
            showcase my work and to provide a centralized location for potential
            employers or collaborators to download my resume and contact me

            <h3 class="mb-500 h3">Conceptualization and Design</h3>
            <p>
              When I first started working on my portfolio website, I spent a
              lot of time checking out other portfolios to see what I liked and
              what I didn't. I wanted to get a sense of what worked well and
              what didn't, both in terms of how the sites looked and how easy
              they were to use. This lead to two phases of the design before
              settling on the final portfolio.
            </p>

          <div class="wrapper-lg pblock-700">
            <img
              src="/assets/case-study-portfolio-design1.webp"
              alt="First Phase of the Design in Figma"
              class="shadow rounded img-center"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <h4 class="h4 mb-400">Phase 1: Asset Creation and Mockups</h4>
            <p class="mb-700">
              Leveraging Figma, I got to work crafting wireframes and
              prototypes, experimenting with color palettes, typography, and
              visual elements. I ended up creating a dark scheme website,
              designing a custom logo with hopes of building a brand for myself
              and style guides to go along with it all to make the next steps
              easier. Ultimately I built a mockup that served as the basis of
              the final design, but it is one I wasn't fully satisfied with.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4 mb-400">Phase 2: Redesign and Simplification</h4>
            <p>
              After reviewing the first phase of the design I realized it was a
              bit too complex for the goal of this website. The purpose of this
              website is to provide a place to showcase my professional work and
              to provide an easy way to get in touch with me. While I thought
              the original design looked great, it was heavy on introduction and
              had a contact form that could potentially cause more friction than
              necessary for professionals that want to contact me. The next
              iteration would be a shorter page with a focus on the portfolio
              work and a simple email button along with a LinkedIn button to get
              in touch with me. This led to settling on what would be the
              current version of my portfolio website.

        <section class="wrapper pb-700">
          <h3 class="mb-500 h3">Development and Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            With the design blueprint in hand, I transitioned to the development
            phase, harnessing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to breathe life into the
            envisioned design. After building the mockup and deciding to ditch
            the contact form I concluded that the website is simple enough to
            create a static site without the need of a Wordpress style content
            management system or anything similar. Embracing the principles of
            responsive web design, I ensured the website's adaptability across
            various devices and screen sizes, prioritizing accessibility and
            performance. Through coding and testing, I fine-tuned every element,
            striving for an accessible and visually pleasing website.

            <h3 class="mb-500 h3">Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              The end result is a website that offers the users two different
              color schemes depending on their device settings &ndash; dark and
              light mode. The website is a monochromatic design that uses a
              different shade of blue as it's accent, and it will vary depending
              on if you are on light or dark mode. The structure of the website
              is simple, a quick about me, my portfolio and contact information
              plus a downloaded version of my resume. This achieved my goal of
              making an accessible website where professionals can contact me
              while having a digital space to share my work.

          <p>
            As I reflect on the journey that brought my portfolio website to
            fruition, I am filled with a profound sense of accomplishment and
            gratitude. The website accomplishes what I set out to do. However, I
            am someone that is always looking to evolve professionally and I am
            poised to leverage this platform as a springboard for new
            opportunities, collaborations, and endeavors, confident in its
            ability to propel my career to new heights.
